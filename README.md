# Shokofin

A Jellyfin plugin to integrate [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) with
[Shoko Server](https://shokoanime.com/downloads/shoko-server).

## Read this before installing

**This plugin requires that you have already set up and are using Shoko Server**,
and that the files you intend to include in Jellyfin are **indexed** (and
optionally managed) by Shoko Server. **Otherwise, the plugin won't be able to
provide metadata for your files**, since there is no metadata to provide for them.

### What Is Shoko?

Shoko is an anime cataloging program designed to automate the cataloging of your
collection regardless of the size and amount of files you have. Unlike other
anime cataloging programs which make you manually add your series or link the
files to them, Shoko removes the tedious, time-consuming and boring task of
having to manually add every file and manually input the file information. You
have better things to do with your time like actually watching the series in
your collection so let Shoko handle all the heavy lifting.

    - [X] Show library

    - [X] Movie library

    - [X] Mixed show/movie library.

      _As long as the VFS is in use for the media library. Also keep in mind that this library type is poorly supported in Jellyfin Core, and we can't work around the poor internal support, so you'll have to take what you get or leave it as is._

    - [X] on Show items

    - [X] on Season items

    - [X] on Movie items

  - [X] Specials and extra features. 

    - [X] Customize how Specials are placed in your library. I.e. if they are
      mapped to the normal seasons, or if they are strictly kept in season zero.

    - [X] Extra features. The plugin will map specials stored in Shoko such as
      interviews, etc. as extra features, and all other specials as episodes in
      season zero.

      _For the best compatibility if you're not using the VFS it is **strongly** advised **not** to use "season" folders with anime as it limits which grouping you can use, you can still create "seasons" in the UI using Shoko's groups._

      - [X] Movies using the Shoko series.

      - [X] Movies and Shows using the Shoko groups.
